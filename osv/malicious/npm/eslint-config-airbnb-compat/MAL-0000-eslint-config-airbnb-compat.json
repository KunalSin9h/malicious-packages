    "summary": "Malicious code in eslint-config-airbnb-compat package (npm)",
    "details": "The npm package `eslint-config-airbnb-compat` is a malicious package impersonating the legitimate Airbnb ESLint configuration. It implements a multi-stage remote code execution attack:\n\n1. The package uses a seemingly benign `postinstall` script that sets up an environment variable pointing to a malicious domain (`https://proxy.eslint-proxy.site`)\n\n2. It introduces a transitive dependency on another malicious package `ts-runtime-compat-check`\n\n3. The dependency makes HTTP requests to the attacker-controlled server, which returns base64-encoded payloads in error messages\n\n4. These payloads are decoded and executed using `new Function.constructor()`, enabling arbitrary code execution\n\nThis supply chain attack is designed to execute attacker-controlled code while masquerading as a legitimate package from Airbnb, likely targeting both direct users and automated security tools through typosquatting.",
