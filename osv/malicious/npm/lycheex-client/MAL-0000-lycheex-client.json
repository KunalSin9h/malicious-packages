  "details": "The package `lycheex-client` contains obfuscated JavaScript code and hex-encoded strings, suggesting malicious intent. YARA rules detected suspicious activity. The file `dist/index.js` is heavely obfuscated, and the presence of anti-debugging techniques, environment checks, hardcoded keys, and network activity strongly suggests malicious behaviour.",
